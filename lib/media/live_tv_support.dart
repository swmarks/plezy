///   heartbeats go through `/Sessions/Playing*`, and [recover] re-uses the

/// Sessions are immutable handles: every operation that changes the playable
/// stream returns a URL or a fresh session for the caller to adopt, so the
/// player's runtime state has a single adoption point.

/// Sessions are pinned to the client that created them. If that server is
