/// Backend-neutral client for a single media server (Plex or Jellyfin).

///
/// Read methods use a `fetch*` prefix. Backend-specific operations that do not
/// fit the neutral browsing/playback surface (DVR tuning, match, rich metadata
/// edit adapters) live on concrete clients or feature modules.
///
/// ## Mutation error and result contracts
///
/// HTTP status, timeout, connection, decode, and cancellation failures from
/// the shared transport surface as [MediaServerHttpException]. Calls for an
/// unsupported advertised capability may throw [UnsupportedError] where the
/// method documents that boundary.
///
/// Result semantics follow each method's declared family. Completion of a
/// `Future<void>` mutation is success and carries no business-result value.
/// Nullable creation methods return `null` only after an accepted request
/// produced no usable created entity or id; request failures throw. Boolean
/// mutations return `true` on their accepted success path, and return `false`
/// only for local preconditions explicitly documented by that method rather
/// than as a substitute for request failure.
///
/// `fetchItem` returns `null` on a real 404 (item gone) and on a 200 that
/// can't be parsed; auth/server errors throw rather than silently dropping
/// to `null`.
