 *
 * This is Kodi's test, and deliberately not media3's. Kodi asks the AudioTrack layer whether it can
 * size a buffer for one exact tuple — `getMinBufferSize(rate, mask, encoding) > 0` — and gates the
 * carrier on the 192kHz/7.1 IEC combination specifically. media3 instead asks the audio policy
 * layer about the encoding, which on the boxes measured for this issue answers "TrueHD is
 * offload-capable" and says nothing about whether a raw TrueHD track will ever drain.
 *
 * Both are consulted: `getMinBufferSize` proves a track can be built, and a route oracle proves
 * the route will actually bitstream it rather than silently decode or wedge. Sizing alone is
 * not sufficient — on a Shield it answers yes for this tuple and the AudioTrack then fails to
 * initialise.
 *
 * The oracle is tiered by what the platform offers:
 * - API 33+: `getDirectPlaybackSupport`, whose bitstream flag also rules out offload-only answers.
 * - API 29–32: `AudioTrack.isDirectPlaybackSupported` for the same tuple. Coarser — it cannot tell
 *   bitstream from offload — but an IEC 61937 track is PCM-shaped by definition, so direct support
 *   for it means the route carries the frames. Fire OS 8 (API 30) devices bitstream TrueHD this way
 *   and lost passthrough entirely under an API 33 gate (#1863). A route that still lies here fails
 *   AudioTrack initialisation, which the audio recovery path answers by force-decoding.
 * - API 24–28: no runtime oracle exists, so the HDMI `AudioDeviceInfo` must explicitly advertise
 *   IEC 61937 at 192kHz/8ch. Shield Experience 8.x is API 28, and the previous flat `false` on
 *   this tier force-decoded TrueHD on routes that genuinely carry it (#1991). A route that
 *   advertises and still refuses the track fails AudioTrack initialisation into the same
 *   recovery path as the tier above.
